      <h2>Problem statement</h2>
      <p>
        Breast cancer is currently the most common cancer globally, with around
        2.3 million people diagnosed with the disease globally each year.
        Although there are many possible causes of non cancerous breast lumps,
        breast cancer most commonly presents as a painless lump or thickening in
        the breast.

        Our project is going to be analyzing datasets of breast lumps, and try
        to find patterns between a benign and malignant tumor. Some of the
        questions we are going to examine are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How does a Malignant person’s breast measurements differ to that of a
          benign person’s measurements ?
        </li>
        <li>
          What does the concavity or the texture have to do with someone who has
          breast cancer ? What is the influence factor?
        </li>
        <li>
          On average what is the range value for each category? For eg, what is
          minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation for Very Low, Medium,
          etc? Does this change for some reason?
        </li>
        <li>Does breast size increase ?</li>
      </ul>
